# Typescript Koans

In this set of examples and tests we cover typescript concepts by building a simple and lighter version of Lodash

### Quick start
**Make sure you have Node version >= 6.0 and NPM >= 3**

> Clone/Download the repo then edit `*.spec.js` files inside [`/test/`](/test/)

> Replace all `__` to fix failing tests

```bash
# clone our repo
git clone https://github.com/hackages/typescript.koans.git

# change directory to our repo
cd typescript.koans

# start the server (`npm install` will be performed for you)
npm start

# start your tests in the console (`npm install` will be performed for you)
npm test

```
go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser

**We use Mocha in this repository**

**For those using `yarn`, make sure to remove the `prestart` script before running `yarn**

**For those using **WallabyJS**, just run it and you'll be on your way to master JS syntax**

### TypeScript
> To take full advantage of TypeScript with autocomplete you would have to install it globally and use an editor with the correct TypeScript plugins.

#### Use latest TypeScript compiler
TypeScript 2.1.x includes everything you need. Make sure to upgrade, even if you installed TypeScript previously.

```
npm install --global typescript
```

#### Use a TypeScript-aware editor
We have good experience using these editors:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Webstorm 10](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [TypeScript plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) with [Typescript-Sublime-Plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/Typescript-Sublime-plugin#installation)
